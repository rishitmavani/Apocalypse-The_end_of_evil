# Apocalypse: The end of evil
Apocalypse: The end of evil is the project made by me and my 2 friends as the last year project of my Diploma engineering. This project has been created in the Unity engine and we have taken some assets from the unity assets store.
This is a zombie first-person shooter (FPS) video game genre centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective that is, the player experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist. The genre shares common traits with other shooter games, which in turn makes it fall under the heading action game. Since the genre’s inception, advanced 3D graphics have challenged hardware development, and cross-platform gaming has been integral.
The protagonist’s arms are at the bottom of the screen, carrying whatever weapon is equipped. The gamer is expected to propel his avatar through the game by moving it forward, backward, sideways, and so on using the keyboard. Forward movements of the controller result in the avatar moving forward through the scenery, usually with a slight left-right rocking motion to properly simulate the human gait. In order to increase the level of realism, we included the dead zombie effects with blood and weapon fire effects.
